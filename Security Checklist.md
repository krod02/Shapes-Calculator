1. Item ID: 3
* Issue: OS access controls are used to only allow authorized changes to be made to code.
* Identifier: SEC-01
* Explanation: 
In order to prevent unauthorized changes being made to my source code files, I utilized my OS access controls. I went through security properties for each source code file, and edited the permissions. This allowed me to modify permissions for each user or group to where only I am allowed to make changes to the files. 

2. Item ID: 9 
* Issue: OS access controls are used to only allow authorized changes to be made to code.
* Identifier: SEC-02
* Explanation: In order to track changes being made to the project, as well as tracking to see who made the changes, I fully integrated Git and Github into my development process. Rather than just uploading the source code files from my file directory into github, I will pull and push changes to github through my IDE. This will allow me to track changes being made to the project.
